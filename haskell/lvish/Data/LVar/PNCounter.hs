This module provides a /PN-Counter/, a counter that allows both
increment and decrement operations.  This is possible because, under
the hood, it's represented with two monotonically growing counters,
one for increments and one for decrements.  The name "PN-Counter"
comes from the literature on /conflict-free replicated data types/.
